# ClarityRead — Reading Mode & Dyslexia Support

ClarityRead is a lightweight browser extension that makes reading on the web easier and more comfortable. It’s built for accessibility: dyslexia-friendly fonts, reflowed reading mode, focus mode, high-contrast themes, and built-in text-to-speech. It also includes a fast, privacy-first summarizer that runs entirely in your browser.

## Key features
- **OpenDyslexic font toggle** for easier letter recognition.
- **Reading / reflow mode** to remove clutter and present readable text.
- **High contrast & invert colors** for low-vision accessibility.
- **Text-to-speech** using the browser’s speechSynthesis API (voices available locally).
- **Local summarizer** — summarization runs in the extension and does not send page content to remote servers by default.
- **Selection-aware summarization** — highlight text on a page to summarize the selection only.
- **Profiles & saved reads** stored locally in the browser.
- **Export / Import** saved reads and profiles (user can export JSON from popup and re-import later).
- **Reading stats** (local-only) visualized in a chart.

## Privacy & Data
ClarityRead is privacy-first. By default, all processing (summaries, TTS via browser, stats) happens locally in your browser. No page text or selections are transmitted to any external server. Saved reads and preferences are stored locally in `chrome.storage.local` and can be exported/imported by the user.


## Usage
- Click the ClarityRead toolbar icon to open the popup.
- Toggle dyslexia font / reflow / high contrast/ invert colors.
- Select text on any webpage and press **Summarize Page** to summarize your text selection.
- Use the export/import buttons to back up or restore saved content and preferences.
- Additional features are shown in the demo.
